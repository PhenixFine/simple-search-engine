# simple-search-engine
Stage 6 of 6 for JetBrains Academy Kotlin [Simple Search Engine project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/89/stages/499/implement).
The program loads a given file - through the command line argument --data - into an array ( if no filename is given, this version will load the file names.txt ) so that the user can search names and email addresses with All, Any, and None commands. Where All - only prints a result if all words are found in the same line, Any - prints all matching lines for each word, and None - prints every line that doesn't match each given word.
